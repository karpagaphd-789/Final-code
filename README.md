Step 1: Download Dataset 1 — DS2OS traffic traces Dataset  

            Download the DS2OS traffic traces dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francoisxa/ds2ostraffictraces  

Step 2: Download Dataset 2 — UNSW_NB15 Dataset  

            Download the UNSW_NB15 dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15

Step 3: Download Dataset 3 — NSL-KDD Dataset  

            Download the NSL-KDD Datasetfrom the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd

Step 4: Download Dataset 4 — iotid20 Dataset  

            Download the iotid20 Dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohulaminlabid/iotid20-dataset

Step 5: Preprocess the Dataset  

            Ensure that each dataset is preprocessed before use.  
            This may include cleaning, normalization, and converting labels into a format suitable for the model.

Step 6: Open the Python Application  

            Navigate to the project folder named:  
            final_code  

Step 7: Open the Main Script  
 
            Open the file named:  
            code.py  

Step 8: Load the Preprocessed Dataset  

            When prompted:  
            - Enter the full path to the preprocessed dataset file (e.g., a CSV file)  
            - Enter the name of the label column from the dataset  

Step 9: Run the Application  

            Execute the script to train and evaluate the model using the provided dataset.

Step 10: View the Output  

            After execution, the model will display the performance results such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Step 11: Repeat for All Datasets  

             Repeat Steps 4 to 9 for each of the three datasets to complete the full evaluation.
